# Session 1 Notes

Dude, holy fuck. Look, I am unstoppable but I don't know about this teacher man.
He's kind of annoying but he's just right enough that I don't want to abandon
the video.
For example, this man has me writing and rewritting things that I never bothered to 
write out manually and I forgot them. In the middle of asking me to write it all out *again*
I realize that I need this video because I forgot it and I forgot it because I didn't do it a million times. 
There is little more that irks me than irritating people who are correct. 
At least this is easy to follow without that stupid scrimba site.
I almost want to take it down on the name alone.
